📌 FastAPI API Automation with CI/CD

🔥 Overview

This repository demonstrates how to set up a FastAPI backend, automate API testing using pytest, and integrate the tests into a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. The project covers fundamental DevOps practices such as continuous testing, test automation, and CI/CD workflow implementation.

🚀 Features

✅ FastAPI backend with basic mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply)

✅ Automated API testing using Python's requests library and pytest

✅ CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions for automated testing on code changes

✅ Configurable GitHub Actions workflow for automated test execution

📌 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

🐍 Python 3.10+

⚡ FastAPI

🔥 Uvicorn

🌍 Requests

🧪 Pytest

📥 Installation

🔹 1. Clone the repository

 git clone [https://github.com/Uttkarshsh/Understanding-Test-Automation-with-GitHub-Actions](https://github.com/Uttkarshsh/Understanding-Test-Automation-with-GitHub-Actions)
 
 cd your-repo

🔹 2. Install dependencies

 pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Running the FastAPI Server

Start the FastAPI server with the following command:

 python app.py

🌍 The server will be available at: http://localhost:8000

🔗 API Endpoints

📌 GET / - Returns a simple welcome message.

📌 GET /add/{num1}/{num2} - Adds two numbers and returns the result.

📌 GET /subtract/{num1}/{num2} - Subtracts two numbers and returns the result.

📌 GET /multiply/{num1}/{num2} - Multiplies two numbers and returns the result.

🛠 Running Tests

✅ 1. Run basic API tests

 python test_pytests.py

✅ 2. Run tests using pytest

 pytest test_pytests.py

🔄 GitHub Actions Integration

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/test.yml) that automates testing on every push or pull request to the main branch.

📌 Steps in the Workflow:

1️⃣ Checkout the repository

2️⃣ Set up Python environment

3️⃣ Install dependencies

4️⃣ Start the FastAPI server

5️⃣ Run API tests using pytest

📌 Setting up GitHub Actions

Push the changes to GitHub to trigger the CI/CD pipeline:

git add .
git commit -m "Add test automation and GitHub Actions"
git push origin main


⚡ You can monitor the test execution under the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.

🌟 Future Enhancements

🔹 Implement database integration (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
🔹 Add authentication and authorization mechanisms
🔹 Enhance logging and error handling
🔹 Perform performance and load testing using locust.io
